# PCA-and-Clustering-with-Python

This tutorial notebook provides a comprehensive guide on how to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Agglomerative Clustering in Python for dimensionality reduction and hierarchical clustering, respectively. These techniques are widely used in machine learning and data analysis for exploring and understanding high-dimensional datasets.

## Introduction to PCA

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while preserving most of its variance. PCA identifies the principal components, which are orthogonal linear combinations of the original features, and ranks them based on the amount of variance they capture.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Overview

PCA aims to find a set of orthogonal axes (principal components) that maximize the variance of the projected data points. These principal components are ordered such that the first component captures the most variance, followed by the second component, and so on. By retaining only a subset of the principal components, PCA reduces the dimensionality of the data while preserving its essential structure.

<i>Use Cases</i>
* Dimensionality reduction
* Visualization of high-dimensional data
* Feature engineering
* Noise reduction

<i>Pitfalls and Considerations </i>

* Interpretability of principal components
* Sensitivity to scale and outliers
* Loss of information
* Assumption of linear relationships


## Introduction to Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical clustering is a popular clustering technique that builds a hierarchy of clusters by iteratively merging or dividing clusters based on their pairwise distances. It does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand, making it suitable for exploratory data analysis and visualizing hierarchical relationships within the data.
Hierarchical Clustering
Overview

Hierarchical clustering begins with each data point as a singleton cluster and iteratively merges the closest clusters until only one cluster remains. The choice of merging clusters is based on a linkage criterion, such as single linkage, complete linkage, or average linkage, which defines the distance between clusters.

<i>Use Cases</i>

* Exploratory data analysis
* Visualization of hierarchical relationships in the data
* Identification of clusters with varying sizes and shapes

<i>Pitfalls and Considerations</i>

* Computational complexity for large datasets
* Sensitivity to distance metric and linkage criterion
* Interpretability of hierarchical structure
* Scalability issues


## Conclusion

This tutorial provides a practical guide on how to use PCA and Agglomerative Clustering in Python for dimensionality reduction and hierarchical clustering, respectively. By understanding the principles, implementation, use cases, and pitfalls of these techniques, you can effectively apply them to your own datasets and gain insights into your data's structure and relationships.
